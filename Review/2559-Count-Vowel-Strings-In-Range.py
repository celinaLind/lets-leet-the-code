DESCRIPTION:

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a 2D array of integers queries.

Each query queries[i] = [li, ri] asks us to find the number of strings present in the range li to ri (both inclusive) of words that start and end with a vowel.

Return an array ans of size queries.length, where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.

Note that the vowel letters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["aba","bcb","ece","aa","e"], queries = [[0,2],[1,4],[1,1]]
Output: [2,3,0]
Explanation: The strings starting and ending with a vowel are "aba", "ece", "aa" and "e".
The answer to the query [0,2] is 2 (strings "aba" and "ece").
to query [1,4] is 3 (strings "ece", "aa", "e").
to query [1,1] is 0.
We return [2,3,0].
Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","e","i"], queries = [[0,2],[0,1],[2,2]]
Output: [3,2,1]
Explanation: Every string satisfies the conditions, so we return [3,2,1].
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 105
1 <= words[i].length <= 40
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
sum(words[i].length) <= 3 * 105
1 <= queries.length <= 105
0 <= li <= ri < words.length

"""
Explanation of Optimizations:
1. Precompute Whether Words Start and End with Vowels:
    Instead of repeatedly checking if each word starts and ends with vowels for every query, this computation is done once for all words using a list comprehension. This results in an O(n) operation, where n is the number of words.
2. Prefix Sum Array:
    To efficiently calculate the count of valid words in any range [start, end], we use a prefix sum array. This array stores the cumulative count of valid words up to each index. By calculating the difference between the prefix sum at the end index and the prefix sum at the start index, we can obtain the count of valid words in the range [start, end]. The prefix sum array is computed in O(n) time. (This remov)
3. Efficient Data Structures:
    Using a set ({'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}) for vowels lookup instead of a list improves the time complexity of membership checks from O(n) to O(1).

    Time Complexity:
- Preprocessing:
    - Checking vowels for all words: O(n)
    - Constructing the prefix sum array: O(n)
- Query Processing:
    - Each query is processed in O(1) due to the prefix sum, resulting in O(m) for m queries.

Total Space Complexity:
    Input Storage: 
        O(n+ùëö)
    Auxiliary Storage: 
        O(n+n+1)=O(n)
        O(n+n+1)=O(n)
    Overall:
        O(n+ùëö)

    O(n+m), where n is the number of words and m is the number of queries.
